## Laboratory Exercise 01 Part 1

### Interpolating the elevations into a higher resolution digital elevation matrix M given a lower resolution digital elevation matrix N

**Installation and running instructions:**

1. The user must first download the file named "exer01.c" included in the submission folder.
2. The user must navigate to the diretory containing the said file.
3. The user must compile and run the c program.
4. Once the c program is running, there will be a prompt to enter a single value n.
5. This will generate a n by n matrix M and will follow the requirements of the exercise.
6. The matrix M will be shown after the interpolation. Also, note that the resulting matrix values are type casted to int for better viewing.
7. The time elapsed will also be shown right after the resulting matrix.
